### 🗑️ Delete List — Test Documentation

This Postman request is part of the process to delete Trello lists that matched a specific filter in a previous step (see **7.GetListsForDeletion**). It uses data stored in environment variables to sequentially archive lists whose names contain a specific pattern (e.g., `P-T List`).

## ⚙️ Pre-request Script

This script retrieves the next list from the deletion queue and updates the environment variables accordingly. Once all lists have been processed, it clears the relevant variables.

```javascript
let index = parseInt(pm.environment.get("deleteIndex") || "0");
let listsToDelete = JSON.parse(pm.environment.get("listsToDelete") || "[]");
let listNamesToDelete = JSON.parse(pm.environment.get("listNamesToDelete") || "[]");

if (index < listsToDelete.length) {
    let currentListId = listsToDelete[index].trim(); // 👉 important dacă au spații
    let currentListName = listNamesToDelete[index];

    pm.environment.set("currentListId", currentListId);
    pm.environment.set("currentListName", currentListName);
    pm.environment.set("deleteIndex", index + 1);
} else {
    pm.environment.unset("currentListId");
    pm.environment.unset("currentListName");
    pm.environment.unset("deleteIndex");
    pm.environment.unset("listsToDelete");
    pm.environment.unset("listNamesToDelete");
    console.log("✅ All lists were processed.");
}
```

---

## ✅ Tests Included

The test checks if the list has been successfully archived and confirms that the correct name and ID were targeted.

```javascript
const listName = pm.environment.get("currentListName");
const listId = pm.environment.get("currentListId");

pm.test(`📛 List "${listName}" (ID: ${listId}) archived`, function () {
    pm.expect(pm.response.code).to.be.oneOf([200, 201]);
});
```
