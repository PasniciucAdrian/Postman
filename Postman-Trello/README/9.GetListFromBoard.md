**Endpoint:**  
`https://api.trello.com/1/boards/{{board_id}}/lists?key={{apiKey}}&token={{apiToken}}`

## ⚙️ Tests Included

This test extracts the list names and IDs from the response, creates an entry for each one in the Test Results tab, and appends a final entry with the date and time of execution.

```javascript
let lists = pm.response.json();

lists.forEach((list, index) => {
    const info = `📌 ${index + 1}. ${list.name} (ID: ${list.id})`;
    pm.test(info, () => {
        pm.expect(list.name).to.be.a('string');
        pm.expect(list.id).to.be.a('string');
    });
});

// 🕒 Append execution date & time
let date = new Date();
let day = date.toLocaleDateString("en-GB", { weekday: 'long' });
let fullDate = date.toLocaleDateString("en-GB");
let time = date.toLocaleTimeString("en-GB");

pm.test(`🕓 Tests executed on ${day}, ${fullDate} at ${time}`, () => {
    pm.expect(true).to.be.true;
});
```
