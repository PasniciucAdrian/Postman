```javascript
let cards = pm.response.json();

pm.test("✅ Cards retrieved", function () {
    pm.expect(Array.isArray(cards)).to.be.true;
    pm.expect(cards.length).to.be.above(0);
});

cards.forEach((card, index) => {
    let info = `📌 ${index + 1}. ${card.name} (ID: ${card.id})`;
    pm.test(info, () => {
        pm.expect(card.name).to.be.a('string');
        pm.expect(card.id).to.be.a('string');
    });
});
```
