### 1. ✔ Status code is 200

let lists = pm.response.json();
let filteredLists = lists.filter(list => list.name.includes("P-T List"));
pm.environment.set("listsToDelete", JSON.stringify(filteredLists.map(list => list.id)));
```

### 3. 🧾 Show Name and ID for Lists to Delete

Loops through the filtered lists and displays both the name and ID for each.

```javascript
filteredLists.forEach((list, index) => {
    pm.test(`🗑️ To Delete ${index + 1} ➔ ${list.name} (ID: ${list.id})`, function () {
        pm.expect(list.id).to.be.a("string");
    });
