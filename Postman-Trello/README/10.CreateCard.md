### 🧾 Create Card in List — Test Documentation

This Postman request is used to create a new card in a specific list on a Trello board. Before running this request, the user must first retrieve the list IDs using the **Get Lists from Board** request (`9.GetListFromBoard.md`) to ensure accurate placement.

## 📊 Environment Variables Used

| Variable      | Description                              |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| `apiKey`      | Trello API key                           |
| `apiToken`    | Trello API token                         |
| `listID`      | ID of the list where the card is added   |
| `ptCardName`  | Name of the card to be created           |

---

## 🔁 Context

The `listID` was obtained from a prior request (`9.GetListFromBoard.md`). This allows the user to create cards dynamically inside the correct list. The `ptCardName` variable can be programmatically incremented to avoid duplicates (e.g., P-T Card 1, P-T Card 2...).
