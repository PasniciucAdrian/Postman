# 12. DeleteCard

## Description

This request is used to delete Trello cards that start with a specific name — in our case, those that begin with **"P-T"**. This is part of a sequence of steps where we first retrieved lists from the board, then created cards, and finally listed them.

## Related Steps

- **9. GetListFromBoard** – to get the ID of the board's lists.
- **10. CreateCard** – to create one or more cards in a specific list.
- **11. GetAllCardsFromList** – to retrieve all cards in the list and filter those named "P-T".

## Pre-request Script

This script sets the correct cardId and card name from the environment based on the current index:

```javascript
let allCards = JSON.parse(pm.environment.get("cardsToDelete") || "[]");
let index = parseInt(pm.environment.get("cardDeleteIndex") || "0");

if (index < allCards.length) {
    let card = allCards[index];
    pm.environment.set("cardId", card.id);
    pm.environment.set("currentCardName", card.name);
} else {
    console.log("✅ All matching cards deleted or no more to delete.");
    pm.environment.unset("cardId");
    pm.environment.unset("currentCardName");
    pm.environment.unset("cardDeleteIndex");
    pm.environment.unset("cardsToDelete");
}
```

---

## Tests

These tests display the name and ID of the deleted card and increment the index for the next one:

```javascript
const name = pm.environment.get("currentCardName");
const id = pm.environment.get("cardId");

pm.test(`🗑️ Deleted card: ${name} (ID: ${id})`, function () {
    pm.expect(pm.response.code).to.be.oneOf([200, 204]);
});

let currentIndex = parseInt(pm.environment.get("cardDeleteIndex") || "0");
pm.environment.set("cardDeleteIndex", currentIndex + 1);
```

## Example

You can use Collection Runner to loop through and delete all cards one by one.
