\# Postman - Trello API Practice



This collection was created as part of a practical Postman training focused on working with the Trello API.



\## üìå Purpose



The goal of this project is to explore and automate operations within Trello using Postman. It includes creating and deleting boards, dynamically generating lists, and managing cards (create, update, delete, retrieve info) via Trello's REST API.



\## üõ†Ô∏è What the Collection Includes



The collection currently contains over 20 detailed requests grouped in logical order:



\- \*\*GET All Boards\*\*

\- \*\*Create a New Board\*\*

\- \*\*Get the ID for a specific board\*\*

\- \*\*Create New Lists (static and dynamic)\*\*

\- \*\*Get, Filter and Delete Lists\*\*

\- \*\*Create Cards (static and dynamic)\*\*

\- \*\*Get Cards from Lists\*\*

\- \*\*Update Cards and Clear Descriptions\*\*

\- \*\*Delete Cards by Filter\*\*

\- \*\*Extract Full Info (Boards, Lists, Cards)\*\*

\- \*\*Test Scripts for Automation and Display\*\*

\- \*\*Timestamped executions in Test Results\*\*



Each request includes pre-request scripts or test scripts where needed, so the execution flow is dynamic and smart. Filtering, naming, and iteration are handled automatically through environment variables and logic in the `Tests` tab.
